# Robotics-Project-2
This is the code for the second project for the course of Robotics at Politecnico di Milano. <br>
The scope of the project was to use Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) to localize the robot while he was mapping an environment.
We were given the position of the robot and the value taken from the sensors; we had first to reconstruct the map pof the environment from the data using SLAM and then perform localization of the robot in the map created.
The project has been done using ROS as middleware and C++ as programming language.
The project has been done in group of three students
